The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple yet classic two-player game, where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbolâ€”either "X" or "O". The objective is to be the first to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

Basic Rules:
Grid Layout: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player Symbols: One player is "X", and the other is "O".
Game Play:
Players alternate turns, marking an empty cell on the grid with their symbol.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
Strategies:
Winning Move: Always be on the lookout for opportunities to place your third symbol in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
Blocking: Prevent your opponent from winning by blocking their potential winning move.
Forking: Create opportunities where you have two ways to win, forcing your opponent into a defensive position
